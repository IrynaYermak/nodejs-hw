Node.js Homework — REST API for Notes and Authentication

This repository contains a full-featured RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, designed to manage user accounts, 
authentication, sessions, and a personal notes collection. The project demonstrates backend architecture, data validation, 
session management, secure authentication, and MongoDB integration.

Key Features

 Authentication & Authorization
User registration with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
User login with credential validation
Session management using access & refresh tokens
Secure cookies for token storage (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
